# Mobile Web Application: Guat-ED
# The Problem
The causes of Guatemalaâ€™s larger gaps are likely related to larger differences across indigenous and nonindigenous students in variables that affect test scores, such as family income or school resources.
# The Solution
Providing quality education in all rural areas of Guatemala is a big challenge.
However, technology can be utilized to improve teaching and learning in rural communities.
The first step is to identify what schools need more help and that is the goal of Guat-ED.
# The Process
A "full stack" application will be created to provide a quality solution to the problem. The backen will be written in the Python programming language

The backend will be written in the Python programming language and gather data from online excel spreadsheets.
